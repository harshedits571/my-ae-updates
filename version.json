[1.1.0] - 2025-05-16
Bug Fixes & Improvements

Solid Button Color Update: Changed default color from red to white for better visibility.
Shape Button Replaced: Removed Shape button and added Bounce button with a bounce expression for animations.
Button Focus Fix: Buttons no longer stay in focus after clicking, so pressing spacebar plays the preview instead of reapplying effects.
Shape Morph Improved: Added clearer error messages when shapes canâ€™t morph (e.g., mismatched vertices).
Edit Shape Enhancement: Added a stroke opacity slider to the Edit Shape panel for more control.
UI Tweak: Increased button spacing in the Layer Creation panel for easier clicking.
