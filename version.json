Bug Fixes & Improvements
Solid Button Color Update: Changed default color from red to white for better visibility.
Shape Button Replaced: Removed Shape button and added Bounce button with a bounce expression for animations.
Button Focus Fix: Buttons no longer stay in focus after clicking, so pressing spacebar plays the preview instead of reapplying effects.
UI Tweak: Increased button spacing in the Layer Creation panel for easier clicking."
